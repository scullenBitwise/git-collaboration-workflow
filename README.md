### Setting up the repository

- - -

1. Create a new GitHub repository: 
    * If creating a brand-new repo with no existing local code, be sure to check 'Add a README file' and optionally 'Add .gitignore'
    * If creating a brand-new repo and linking it up to existing local code, do not add a README or .gitignore through GitHub
2. Set branch protection rules for the main/main branch.
3. Add all team members as collaborators.
4. Have each teammate clone the repository.
5. Each teammate should now set up their first branch and begin work.

  **All work from here on out will be done in a branch. Each team member should create a branch each time they take on a new task.**

  **Think about your branch as a sandboxed copy of the latest code, which allows you to complete the ticket or task assigned without impacting the main branch or the work of your teammates. After you are confident in your work and have it completed, you will initiate a pull request to pull/merge this code into main.**

### Once the repository is set up, repeat this process to create a new branch

- - -

1. Start on your local 'main' branch (you may need to run `git switch main`.)
2. Before creating a new branch, **make sure you have no active changes on main by running a `git status`.** If you see something like `nothing to commit, working directory clean`, you're good to go!
3. Now, run a `git pull origin main` to update your local main to the latest version of the origin (Internet) main. That way the new branch you're about to create will be based on your team's latest code.
4. Run `git switch -c your-branch-name-here` (note: this creates a new branch with the specified name, and also switches you into that branch.)
    * Name your branches based on the task you're presently undertaking, and use dashes instead of camelcase. Good examples would be 'search-bar-logic' or 'initial-styling' or 'ajax-call'. It is recommended that you avoid creating one branch per team member and using that same branch throughout the entire project (ie 'sarah' or 'sarah-branch') as this method causes more merge conflicts in the long run.

### As you work within your branch

- - -
* Code away!
* **Remember to add/commit your code each time you make progress you would be sad to lose!!!**
* Repeat until your task/feature is complete.

### Merge conflicts!!??

- - -
A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically reconcile differences in between the code changes of two different commits. (When all the changes in the code occur on different lines or in different files, Git will successfully merge together commits *without* a merge conflict.) When there are conflicting changes on the same lines, a merge conflict occurs because Git doesnâ€™t know which code to keep/which to discard.

> "Conflicts generally arise when two people have changed the same lines in a file, or if one developer deleted a file while another developer was modifying it. In these cases, Git cannot automatically determine what is correct. Conflicts only affect the developer conducting the merge, the rest of the team is unaware of the conflict. Git will mark the file as being conflicted and halt the merging process. It is then the developers' responsibility to resolve the conflict." - [Atlassian's wonderful Git documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts)

We recommend fixing merge conflicts through a combination of your command line (Terminal or Bash) and VSCode. Consider working with Sarah through your first few merge conflicts, until you get a better handle on the process. **Always make sure to test your code *after* you've completed the merge conflict resolution but *before* you add/commit/push your changes.** This allows you to catch code issues immediately, and to redo the merge if necessary!

**NEVER ATTEMPT TO FIX MERGE CONFLICTS THROUGH THE GITHUB WEBSITE**, as this can and often does cause broken code.

### Merging main into your branch, pushing, and creating a pull request

- - -
The origin 'main' branch is updated every time you or your teammates create a pull request and merge new code into main. In some cases, you may want or need to merge the code from 'main' into your current working branch.

You typically do this before creating a pull request to merge your branch's code into main. This is to make sure your code plays nice with 'main' and any work your teammates have added since you created your current branch. If a merge conflict occurs, you can fix the conflicts locally as necessary. To merge 'main' into your current local branch, follow the steps below:

1. Run a `git status` to verify that there are no outstanding local changes. If there are, add/commit your changes (no need to push yet, though!) before proceeding.
2. Run `git switch main` to switch over to the 'main' branch'
3. Run `git pull origin main` to pull down (download) the latest changes from the GitHub 'main' branch and your local repo's 'main' branch.
4. Run `git switch your-branch-name-here` to switch back over to your local working branch.
5. Run `git merge main` to merge the updated changes from your local 'main' branch into your working branch.
6. Fix conflicts if needed! (Use Terminal/Bash to determine which files have conflicts; you can then handle the conflicts via your code editor.)
7. After verifying the code works properly, run another `git status` and add/commit if needed. (note: any merge conflicts you fix will need to be added/committed).
8. Run `git push origin your-branch-name-here` to push the updates to the GitHub copy of your branch, now confident your branch code plays nice with the code in 'main'.
9. On GitHub.com:
    * Create a pull request (note: make sure your pull request is merging your branch into 'main'.)
    * Hit the 'Cubmit pull request' button.
    * Request that one of your teammates approve/review your pull request.
    * After approval, either you or your approving teammate can merge the pull request. (note: this merge will integrate the approved code from your branch into the main branch.)
    * Optionally delete this branch on GitHub and the branch owner's local computer.
10. Notify your teammates that new code has been added to 'main', so that they can pull/merge if desired to get the latest code!
11. Now run `git switch main`, `git pull origin main`, and repeat the process above by creating a new branch.
